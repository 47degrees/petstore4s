**THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED â€” USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

It has been a fun and great project but it's time for us to move on. Check out our recent work that we are doing with Scala and follow us on Github and Twitter for new and exciting open source projects. Thanks for your continuing support. If you wish to take on maintenance of this library please contact us through the issue tracker.

# Petstore

This project shows how to generate code (an HTTP client and server) based on OpenApi Specification 3.0.0, using [Mu](http://higherkindness.io/mu-scala/).

## Specification

This is the [specification](./protocol/src/main/resources/petstore/petstore.yaml) input, based on a **petstore**, we are using to define the code we want to generate. If you want to view the specification in a more human-readable format, please use the following [editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

## How to use it

Start the server:

```sh
> sbt "server/run"
```

In a separate terminal, run the client:

```sh
> sbt client-example/run
```

You should see some log output like this:

```
11:09:52.199 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - Pet = Right(Pet(1,Beethoven,None))
11:09:52.255 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - My pets = List(Pet(2,Meadow,Some(female-dog)), Pet(1,Beethoven,None))
11:09:52.281 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - No existing pet = Left(Inl(GetPetNotFoundResponseError(Not found pet with id: -1)))
11:09:52.306 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - My new pet list = List(Pet(1,Beethoven,Some(updated)), Pet(2,Meadow,Some(female-dog)))
11:09:52.313 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - Updated Pet = Right(Pet(1,Beethoven,Some(updated)))
11:09:52.314 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - Deleting pet with id 1 from the catalogue...
11:09:52.337 [scala-execution-context-global-18] INFO  p.client.Boot - My pet list updated = List(Pet(2,Meadow,Some(female-dog)))
```

## Generated code and hand-written code

Mu's sbt plugin parses the OpenAPI specification file and generates Scala code
for:

* The request and response models
* An HTTP client based on http4s

If you want to inspect the generated code, run `sbt compile` and then take a
look in the `protocol/target/scala-2.12/src_managed/` directory.

As a user, you need to write the code for the HTTP server, making use of the
generated model classes. Take a look at the `server` project for an example of
how to do that.
